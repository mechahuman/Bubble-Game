# Bubble-Game

This is a simple web based game that cures free time and boredom.
THE RULES OF THE GAME ARE that one should hit the bubble with the number displayed above in the "Hit" section and one gets only 60 seconds to do so.
Every correct hit will lead to increase in score by 10 points and it will also reset the board containing the numbers.

This project was referred and learnt from Sheriyans Coding School on youtube; to build stronger html, css, javascript concepts.
